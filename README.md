# SampleOpenIDConnect

This project is sample project to demonstrate an issue with the authentication library with using MSAL (for AAD and AAD B2C) or OIDC when developer wants to include the user token to the backend API using the **BaseAddressAuthorizationMessageHandler** class. 

See [https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/security/webassembly/additional-scenarios?view=aspnetcore-6.0&WT.mc_id=DX-MVP-5004641#attach-tokens-to-outgoing-requests](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/security/webassembly/additional-scenarios?view=aspnetcore-6.0&WT.mc_id=DX-MVP-5004641#attach-tokens-to-outgoing-requests) for the documentation that I followed to provide this sample.
